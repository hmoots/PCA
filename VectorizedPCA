# Which was inspried by https://x.com/leonardojo/status/1828773827134062967

# Install necessary packages if not already installed
install.packages("svglite")
install.packages("ggplot2")

# Load the ggplot2 library
library(svglite)
library(ggplot2)

# Create a basic boxplot of Sepal Length by Species (Replace with PCA code
p <- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length, fill = Species)) +  
  geom_boxplot() +  
  labs(title = "Sepal Length", y = "Sepal Length", x = "Species")

# Save the plot as an SVG file
ggsave("sepal.svg", p, device = "svg")

# Can be edited in your prefered graphics applications, such as Affinity Designer
